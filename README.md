Overlay for my Splatoon 3 Beating Every Weapon challenge

To Use:

1. Make sure you have ALL the files!!
2. In OBS create a browseer source and click local file. Select your prefered difficulty HTML file.
In the creation tab set width to 1920 and height to 1080. To make it larger or smaller, resize using the red box in the projector; not the properties tab. 
3. Click the element and press "Interact". This is where you will pick your weapon and notify wins and losses.

For Non-Random versions
1. Click above the three buttons (red, green, blue) and put in the weapon you want to play. Due to how it works it IS case sensitive, but you can use this spreadsheet to copy and paste the name in 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1571hcaLft9jv9cNETIGSGu0_eOblzTboK5e3kOFPXy4/edit?usp=sharing (It is in alphabetical order).
2. Once you have your weapon in the box; press the blue button to update the image.
3. To manually reset everything type "RESET" in the box and press the green button

For Random Versions
1. For random, the function of the green and red buttons remain unchanged. There is no text box in this version.
2. To manually reset, press the blue button. The main reason to do this is for a bug or to reroll your first weapon.

If you win; press the green button

If you lose; press the red button
